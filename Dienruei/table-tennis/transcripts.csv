0:0:0,and this right now is the time where every table tennis fan in the world wants to see what will happen between the man on top right there Ma Long the dragon the dictator the captain he's world-ranked number one he's the Olympic
0:0:15,gold medalist he's the standing world champion from Sujo in 2015 and the only player that seems like a serious contender and he's beaten Ma Long once on the world tour and despite having beaten him three times in the
0:0:30,same Chinese Super League season going 3-0 when the pressure is there there seems to be a mental block or hurdle that is keeping Fan Zhendong from becoming world number one and this will be a real test for the 20 year old
0:0:45,"to see if he can overpower and outsmart, more importantly, Ma Long here to become the world champion at 20 years old. There's the cup they'll be playing for, the world champions, we'll see."
0:1:0,"Fan Zhendong on his side of the draw started off beating Paragorel of Sweden 4-0 One of the best servers in the game, very difficult to play but Fan Zhendong steady in that An average of a little less than 5 points per game it appears"
0:1:15,"of the year. of the year. of the year. This was a 4-2 This was a 4-2 victory over victory over Ruan Filus. Ruan Filus. Again, for a defender to take Again, for a defender to take two games off of Fan Zhendong. two games off of Fan Zhendong. Really impressive. Really impressive. So let's see what else after So let's see what else after that."
0:1:30,"And the amount of championship titles, you can see the results here. Look how many championship titles we have. 2008, 9, 11, 15, and 16. So we're keeping track. I know Ma Long is chasing Vladimir Samsonov."
0:1:45,for world tour titles but as world champion this is just dominant performance out here and again it's been a question of time world ranked number two Fan Zhendong with explosive power on both sides he's got the touch he showed us that roller under the net clamp against
0:2:0,commentator narrates a specific sports game
0:2:15,"ball powerfully from both sides and have touch. What are your thoughts Gavin? That's exactly it. You get to the world number one, two, three, four. It really is a mental game. Possibly on the world tour."
0:2:30,"guys are playing with with small injuries throughout the season but you always feel when it gets to the really big pinnacle event of the year it's the outstanding two that do get to the final. The world number one, world number two."
0:2:45,to be played.
0:3:0,"against Ma Long. It was in the China Open in 2016. It was a 4-0 victory, but Ma Long has won every other encounter. He's 10-1 against Fan Zhendong, although we do have to look at the most recent matches."
0:3:15,to
0:3:30,"to be maintaining his level, but there's not much other place to go than down from here. By the time he's 30, if he's still able to keep up this performance, Fan Zhendong is going to be 22 years old and still on the incline on his way up."
0:3:45,"A solid backhand at the back of the table, early in the match again, players still feeling each other out. They were actually warming each other up in the practice hall, interestingly enough."
0:4:0,"Now we talk a lot about mental focus. In the practice hall just earlier, there was a member of the staff who had a medical emergency that was quite scary, and I noticed Fang Zhendong, everyone was looking at him."
0:4:15,"was watching in concern, but Fan Zhendong was very focused and made sure that he kept his head in the match for practice here."
0:4:30,Not a point dropped yet from the focused Xiaopang Fangjiandong.
0:4:45,sweet spot and how big it is on the backhand side that ball's a wide to the backhand shot and he's moving to get to it but still able to counter and generate a lot of pace it's always like he's making his shot while moving the setup for the next so fast
0:5:0,"First point for Ma Long so far. By the way, as we get started on this match, if you have any questions for the commentators, you can send them into the social media."
0:5:15,on social media at I T T F world at I T T F world on all social media hashtag ask the commentator Gavin and I'll be happy to take those questions.
0:5:30,And that's interesting there. Fan Zhendong opting in this early exchange to go with the little reverse serve. It's a very similar action to the Zhang Jike reverse serve.
0:5:45,"I feel like because we've seen Fan Zhendong playing later into most tournaments than we've seen Zhang Jike recently he's almost sort of taking ownership over that serve, the reverse pendulum"
0:6:0,and I have to take it back to that meal in Kuwait few years ago 2015 with Ma Long and Fan Zhendong and one thing Ma Long said is he said I wish I was fatter which he said with affection like Fan Zhendong so I could hit with
0:6:15,more
0:6:30,"full of Nutella and bacon, which you wouldn't expect an athlete maybe in the past to be eating, but he was loading up on animal fats and a lot of stuff to make sure he had an unusual amount of energy."
0:6:45,short side of the table beautiful shot from Ma Long we're seeing some slow sort of uh development on Ma Long's side of the table Gavin what do you think would be responsible other than the quality of Fan Zhendong's shots? yeah just misfiring a little bit
0:7:0,"a bit early on. You know it's important that he can find a little foothold in this match, possibly touching a little bit shorter than he is at the moment to get that first attack into the right area."
0:7:15,Here's the St. Bride race that they'll be playing for since 1929 in London to honor Fred Perry winning the title.
0:7:30,"1929 a lot of people don't think of fred terry of fred perry for his table tennis, but tennis and table tennis A bit like you gavin I think it'll be a while since we you know until we see that repeated"
0:7:45,Someone winning a major in both tennis and table tennis. I know Monfils is quite a recreational player.
0:8:0,Commentator narrates a specific sports game.
0:8:15,
0:8:30,"A little bit off the top of the net, but power for power, the backhands just explode one after another. Landmines going off at the corners of the table."
0:8:45,but that was better there mile long just just settling things down a little bit around the net that's where he can sometimes be in the ascendancy
0:9:0,"So while he's made a comeback by quite a bit, he still has a ways to go. Fang Zhendong again, much like as far as the mental game."
0:9:15,"just like the other players against Ma Long who are strong underdogs where Fan Zhendong is not, it's important that he gets in early to keep Ma Long playing nervous and keep a bit of confidence on his side of the table"
0:9:30,"So quick with that backhand, just a bullet back down the line, a parallel shot anyway. Now five game points for Pan Zhendong to take the first with authority."
0:9:45,Look at the quads on Fan Zhendong. The little wishbone above the kneecap.
0:10:0,Commentator narrates a specific sports game.
0:10:15,you have to think of another way to win points that will be either little short exchanges around the net or little subtle changes in direction throughout the rallies. So one game point saved the serves are on the side of Fan Zhendong
0:10:30,Дякую за перегляд!
0:10:45,"Well placed push deep on the table. Fast, long push, you know, can be so good if the surprise factor is there and it's deep. And as long as you don't just go right onto a wedge."
0:11:0,right well placed in the middle there by Ma Long
0:11:15,"oh man to get those back! what an effort from Ma Long, and what determination and focus from Fan Zhendong to finish that point! This is going to be in the highlights for sure!"
0:11:30,I felt like the patience of Fang Zhendong was so impressive to keep Ma Long from getting the first attack. Very confident play from the 20-year-old and Fang Zhendong 11-7 over the standing world champion and Olympic gold medalist in game one.
0:11:45,Game 1 will be back for Game 2 right after this.
0:12:0,— А ... — Долгожданне!
0:12:15,"игра, в соответствии с рекламой, ведь телефон готов на использование специально дляsy mad rider"
0:12:30,"And as the drums were beaten, Ma Long was beaten in game one as well. Now we saw a chance, I'd say we got a chance to look at the rackets and the equipment."
0:12:45,"on the table, Ma Long's racquet, Fan Zhendong's racquet. It appeared that the sponge on Fan Zhendong's forehand was a bit thicker than Ma Long's. What were your thoughts on that Gavin with the table tennis legends and what not? Yeah, obviously with the thicker sponge."
0:13:0,that
0:13:15,the Swedish legends of Jannevi Valdner and Jörgen Persson. They always opted to use the 1.9 sponge which was notably thinner than other players. So giving them a little bit more touch.
0:13:30,"Excellent shot, playing the high risk. That is a very interesting thing to pay attention to. I mean, Waldner often thought of as the greatest touch of all time. And then what you're willing to sacrifice. People always ask, what would you recommend? I'm just getting started, or who knows."
0:13:45,"Yeah, different preferences for different players, of course. Fan Zhendong, the cannon on both sides and the touch. Almost, if that one comes back around the net. We got another shot of the year."
0:14:0,potential here the angle look how far he has to go to get that there was one point with John G Coe where he was going the opposite way and slid back to recover a netball was so amazing
0:14:15,"Again, turns just early enough, I guess I should say just late enough to not give away the opening, but early enough to get around this ball and play it down the line."
0:14:30,he was really misfiring in that first set but he still has the confidence to try these shots just because they were missing in the first set you've got to keep going
0:14:45,"Beautiful rally and an excellent finish from Fang Zhendong. You know, we're talking about confidence. For his whole career, Ma Long was winning. He had a head-to-head winning record against Zhang Jike."
0:15:0,"The match became important, Zhang Jike would always steal the title, and it seemed like a confidence reducer, something that just, Ma Long needed confidence, and in 2015 he found that, and hasn't been stopped since, hasn't slowed down."
0:15:15,but it seems like Fan Zhendong is finding some real confidence That's world class play from Fan Zhendong but I feel there the last couple of points they've been really good points for Ma Long as well the backhand-backhand exchange in the second last point he changed the pace
0:15:30,is
0:15:45,or backhand-to-backhand exchange with Ma Long changing pace.
0:16:0,"Sometimes not hitting it hard shows your confidence, that you're willing to change the pace and deal with the heat and give it right back to the opponent."
0:16:15,"assets on the field in that game. A very good backhand off the bounce, allowing Fan Zhendong to open first. Very bold play. And it was really bold play round the net there as well, he was doing a little bit more on the receive, he wasn't just touching short with less spin so that Fan Zhendong could, could spin freely as well. That's a very dumb offense. You know there's only one way to hold an offense. If you have an active player, there's no guaranteed behind you an offence to be able"
0:16:30,between a young girl and a cyborg.
0:16:45,Just incredible points to recover that ball from wide to the forehand and get back into the backhand blocking and fishing game. And again Pham Dung is going to try to keep Ma Long pinned in the backhand and only go to the forehand in this situation when he
0:17:0,
0:17:15,"The lobbing the ball back on the table for six or sevens, just not enough. You can see Ma Long there, looking to change the pace as he draws the ball."
0:17:30,the game.
0:17:45,Don't you go? That is going for growth. Gavin wanted to see it chop there.
0:18:0,could have been could have been the the German Steffi Graf in the tennis a nice little chiseling slice is what I hoped I was going to see there it was all set up here look at this
0:18:15,"If that ball comes down, it's going to be deep into the body on the backhand side. Very difficult and ambitious shot for Ma Long to take. But again, with that confidence comes some fearlessness and he will take risks."
0:18:30,"Big point to break the momentum. I remember 5-2 on the scoreboard, and suddenly it was a one point game. Now I brought up the past, talking about the chances of these two."
0:18:45,to be played in the final and you get a lot of different opinions about who it's going to be and it feels like Ma Long still has the upper hand just based on mental maturity and experience under pressure. Looking at the results again 10 to 1
0:19:0,head-to-head is quite a statement because Fan Zhendong has been world number two for some time now and and the way that the world ranked
0:19:15,
0:19:30,as well. I think it'll take awhile even if Fong Zhendong wins before he takes over the number one world ranking.
0:19:45,"Great start to this final though. Both players playing some of their best table tennis. And this is where you want to be doing that. Not out in the practice hall, right here."
0:20:0,a Sports Commentator
0:20:15,the top and side spin and relatively shallow on the table ma long look at this about a foot and a half maybe two feet inside the line and ma long reaches forward keeps the racket closed you talked about that tacky top sheet on the Chinese
0:20:30,"National Team rubber, very closed racket, very important for Ma Long. Short side of the table and the risk pays off. Ma Long with four game points to tie it up, this could be a seven game extra."
0:20:45,"On the way Ma Long is playing right now, he's definitely turning things around He's not won many points when it's been fast diagonal exchanges So he's had to use that brain of his, playing to the middle, playing some shots down the way"

0:22:30,back for game three ma long in red at the bottom of the screen ties it up again the change of pace a real success for ma long
0:22:45,Now again we got to have some conversation and break. We were talking about world rankings and the new system Looking at the points between them. It's actually much closer than I realized Fan Zhendong might be able to come out world number one if he wins this match
0:23:0,"He fired up indeed, you know, the rivalry is interesting because the camaraderie of being on the same national team, practice partners and close friends, maybe even mentors."
0:23:15,"On some level when you're out here, it's all business and the fight. This is actually a sign of respect giving your all Using the length of the table for all that power and speed"
0:23:30,"And see how much Ma Long has to think out there. In his other matches he can just play fairly standard, but here he's mixing the serves, he's mixing the placements as often as he can."
0:23:45,"Netball there too wide a bit of sidespin on it hooking out to the forehand side So with the new ranking system, I have a chance to see what the world rankings would be in"
0:24:0,And Ma Long would still be top 1 over Fan Zhendong but Zhang Jucko would actually be number 5 in the world and Wang Chunting would be number 4 If anyone is petroleum enthusiast call 2434
0:24:15,means that how far you get means that how far you get rather than who the oppo ball. It's worth no more
0:24:30,It will encourage more participation so that you have a chance hopefully to see your favorite players the big four from China and all others at the top of the world on the world tour pretty consistently.
0:24:45,"Wow, too fast, so deep on the table when he keeps it that close to the baseline sometimes you question yourself to even know if it made it you can hear that little tick before it hit the shirt maybe a little bit off the top"
0:25:0,azzam elwa am y gyfforddiad cha erbyn y diwrnod.
0:25:15,you think about it sport like tennis 20 meters between you and your opponent in table tennis you've only got four or five meters between the two of you
0:25:30,This would be equivalent to someone like Roger Federer trying to serve and you're actually on the same side of the court as him trying to return that service. I mean lightning-quick reactions you need for table tennis
0:25:45,"Indeed the reaction time. It actually comes down to equipment, not comes down to, but includes the equipment that you use that's built for this type of speed. The angle there, the punch and tone created with the backhand, you mentioned before."
0:26:0,how difficult it is for the wrist to go that way the natural inclination would be played down the line I think it was in doubles you talked about this the fondant don't pulling some magic out there from over the table
0:26:15,So well timed with that rocket backhand. Ma Long really seems to be setting up some plays.
0:26:30,and getting the shots he wants right into the wheelhouse to win the points.
0:26:45,"A man is seen turning a corner, stays in at the table, gets the racket out in front to keep the ball coming in."
0:27:0,
0:27:15,who were unable to return who were unable to return
0:27:30,wow the power doesn't faze ma long and right after you talk about the elbow we see when we would use that raised elbow when you're in near the table and need to generate all the spin look at the ma long fan club there with the ma long hats tiaras
0:27:45,"...maybe. Got some interesting questions coming in here, try to take them on towel break."
0:28:0,as we go to the second towel break now this question i'm going to send to you because you're an equipment maker yourself gavin the question is from jacob viper
0:28:15,Does one of the players use a carbon sponge? Now generally carbon of course applying to the blade. I know Ma Long has his own blade and Fan Zhendong is playing with a Stiga Do you know the specifics and the ingredients if they have carbon in their blades?
0:28:30,"Yeah, I mean obviously the the carbon results in a much faster surface Sometimes with with this carbon that's a little bit faster. You have a soft carbon as well So that can always give you a little bit more"

0:30:15,"and a fan making a very cool sign I believe it was from the last time that Ma Long won the major title jumped up on the table, pointed out to the audience that was 2015 in Suzhou when Ma Long"
0:30:30,took the world championship so we were talking a little bit about the surface and the material the blades from Hinoki to all wood and you were telling me a little bit about that Gavin yeah
0:30:45,
0:31:0,"The players looking to flick out and dominate. It's important as well that you can put an emphasis on being able to feel the ball and the, you know, the death touch around the net."
0:31:15,"I think this next question that comes in is quite a good one for that point. But Wemo asks, do you think the Chinese players relax and explode, relax and explode before every shot to maintain powerful shots?"
0:31:30,"You know Gavin, I'll let you take this one as the the color in the expert here. Yeah, I mean obviously these guys The look what's really important in the duration of a longer rally is that you breathe? Properly a lot of these guys are actually exhaling"
0:31:45,
0:32:0,Exhale as you hit the ball and sometimes we can hear it a second after when dima's playing That's funny in weightlifting as well you can think about it when you're blowing out when you're exhaling
0:32:15,"in the most effort. So th important. And I think kn relaxing and exploding wi efficient way, much like knows when to use the gas battery. Same with the pla"
0:32:30,to take care of their bodies for maximum performance. This could be an hour 15 minute match. Although the speed of some of the points the rally lengths I think you're getting into it pretty quickly there's not
0:32:45,"played as much touch play over the table and they're not, I guess they're both being stubborn to not back off the table, trying to stay in and stay aggressive. So the points are ending a little quicker than usual."
0:33:0,"To cover that ball, as wide as Fang Zhendong gets in with that wrist and plays it out with the Chiquita. Ma Long reaching, but the way he reaches, it's almost like he leaves his feet behind."
0:33:15,"so that he doesn't get out of position at all and can quickly just flex his body back up and recover. Now Gavin, you had the experience of playing T-Mobile and you were saying how it's a whole different level out here. Are you excited?"
0:33:30,of
0:33:45,really tough when you're out there on table one having to compete against one of these sensational players and that was Heinz the Hornman in full effect for the around the net shot that Fan Zhendong just hit that was chop blocked back by Ma Long to win the point
0:34:0,"Again, for those of you at home, the chop block is a last resort from the backhand that has some Backspin and some a lot of sidespin on it and it's tough to tell how much there is a glitch Smart play the ball was left out in front of my long"
0:34:15,"when he uses a lot of wrist and a lot of spin to make a secure shot instead of going for a clear winner. Well, Gavin, when they showed Fan Zhendong's hand before the serve, it looked like it was shaking. That's just the adrenaline kicking in. Massive amounts of adrenaline."
0:34:30,y gallwch chi fynd i'r holl sport i ymgyrchu eich hun a gallu chwarae o'r lefel llawer iawn.
0:34:45,"And again, for those of you at home who are a little bit newer to table tennis, the wiping of the hand on the table is to wipe the sweat off and make sure they have full grip."
0:35:0,the match.
0:35:15,I'm a little bit nervous now
0:35:30,"I don't know about you, but after that exchange, which is quite impressive, Ma Long had a little bit more time here and it seemed like he really just tried to do a bit too much and hit it harder than he needed to, which is tough to say because even 80% for Ma Long is so fast."
0:35:45,And a timeout. Remember neither player has a coach in their corner as they are both from the same national association. Yesterday I had a chance to see Lu Guoliang in the practice hall with Fang Zhendong who was lying down near the edge of the ring.
0:36:0,the table for a bit maybe visualizing and just relaxing before his match but these two practicing together this morning and also Wang Hao I saw coaching Fan Zhendong as he was practicing with Zhou Yu earlier on in the tournament
0:36:15,"A little fun fact about Fan Zhendong, he won the men's world cup last year Ma Long not participating So, in that tournament, by winning that it means Fan Zhendong if he wins this, will only need to win the Olympics"
0:36:30,"to become a Grand Slam champion alongside Ma Wong, Ko Linghui, Liu Guoliang, Waldner and Zhang Jike, of course. I was like, who's the one I'm leaving out? The guy who got knocked out by Li Sangsu earlier, the legend that half of the band..."
0:36:45,
0:37:0,Commentator comments Commentator comments Commentator comments
0:37:15,so we saw with the women's singles final with Zhu Yuling and Ding Ning it could have gone to Zhu Yuling being 3-1 up and Ding Ning tying it up was crucial to sort of the momentum in that match
0:37:30,"Pivotal moment of the match now for Fan Zhendong. He needs to keep the heat on, he needs to be hitting the ball fast, get the power on the ball. It's Ma Long that needs to change placements, change spins, change directions."
0:37:45,Mario dominant we've not seen enough of that from fan zeng dong so far it's just
0:38:0,The next video
0:38:15,And Fan Zhendong stole the point. That can be pretty crushing. And he's got a second serve here to do it. That's an interesting call for the timeout on your opponent's serve. Wow! So we're seeing...
0:38:30,on youtube will
0:38:45,"longs tactic of slowing it down, playing slower, arcing backhand top spins. So yeah, a lot of resilience shown, but really by both men. Yeah. I mean, it's something, you know, it's Tongsendong might have more power."
0:39:0,"If you're all power, it's the versatility and the adaptability, I'd say the improvisation, the improvisation that Ma Long brings to the game that makes him so tough."
0:39:15,
0:39:30,quickly or else Fan Zhendong will reach it again on the wide forehand. I love that let receive back into your own side of the table.
0:39:45,A little bit of swag from Fang Zhendong shows some confidence and probably relaxes him a bit too Big point to hang on to the two-point lead again once you've used
0:40:0,"when you choose your time out, you want to make it worth it you don't want to have to get deep in the match when you wish you had another one ma long takes this game time out will have been well spent when that was interesting in there my long the last few points has just been dribbling the backhand over the net"
0:40:15,and only there introduced a lot of power and it was successful.
0:40:30,strong opening but once agai to reach out and cover th have to imagine that even he almost loosens up his
0:40:45,and was shot in the foot.
0:41:0,"Oh, beautiful inside out step around forehand attack from Feng Zhendong."
0:41:15,well he has this shot clearly in his arsenal it's a shot we just haven't seen come up too many times so far this match well that looked spectacular but actually that was just a percentage play a big reloop on the diagonal
0:41:30,right he got a 75 percenter from Ma Long and he could see that it was coming long cross-court so he set up and turned around
0:41:45,"Lightning speed from both sides, four shots in a row exchanged as fast as anyone can hit it in the world. And again their timing to stay close to the table for this. If you watch this..."
0:42:0,replayed time and time again and you only watch one player just consider how little time they have between each stroke which is why it's so important that they're able to you have the muscle strength to not only relax but recover and set up again three game plans
0:42:15,from how long.. to take a three to one lead. Oh! almost comes back. The scooping shot from down below the table I'd love to-
0:42:30,improves on his performances.
0:42:45,"to take advantage and catch it before it drops. Here it is, the swoopy sidespin from under the table, catches a little bit off the top of the net, still not an easy ball."
0:43:0,wasn't very high when he hit it. So two serves if Fan Zhendong can get this point.
0:43:15,It sounded like there was a little conversation with the umpire. He's trying to look over at the hands of the umpire. Sometimes a service warning. Again they are quite particular.
0:43:30,in particular at this tournament being the biggest tournament of the year.
0:43:45,It's three games to one. This could be the last game of the men's singles event for the World Championships. Stay right here. Game five coming up.

0:44:30,"With each winning ball, a team has to negotiate a penalty for the next veteran of the team, thus giving each team a second chance to play the game"
0:44:45,And the wave starts going around the stadium once again for the men's team.
0:45:0,"singles final. As we come back for game 5, we've got a question from Lex Anders. Does hashtag Ma Long take the lead because he is preparing his attacks through avoiding the backhand of Fang Zhendong? Hashtag Fang Zhendong."
0:45:15,"in which a player is playing the fast backhand to backhand exchanges. If he plays to the backhand corner, he's doing it with less speed and a little bit more spin. Obviously then when he turns and plays his forehands, he's looking to go into the middle and forehand of Fan Zhendong."
0:45:30,"Excellent counter. Pins Ma Long right in the chest with the shot. When I say chest, I feel like it actually has to be the left shoulder from the start of this for it to be a problem for Ma Long to turn on."
0:45:45,You tried to go around the net there to the short side
0:46:0,that 
0:46:15,sometimes even serving a fast serve and getting into a quicker exchange.
0:46:30,"He played out wide to the forehand of Ma Long, he brought it a good foot closer to the center of the table this time, maybe hoping that Ma Long would overrun it or not get such a full-arm stroke, and it would set up the attack stronger for Fan Zhendong to the backhand corner."
0:46:45,Beautiful shot. Close
0:47:0,"Super reload there and if we remember back to the previous game, when he stepped around that corner he went safe and went on the diagonal, not this time, look at that shot."
0:47:15,"He really has to fan the racket up and over and come down after the ball to keep it low to the short side. Again, less forgiveness, less margin for error."
0:47:30,or sports activity on local television.
0:47:45,"So for both of these players, neither of them has been pushed to Game 7 so far in this tournament."
0:48:0,and I do think that as one statement about how strong their games are even against their compatriots they just haven't been tested the way that they have the chance to test each other out here right now and Fan Zhendong really looking to take this game you can see
0:48:15,Five points to one He's gonna have to stay focused. But the way he's focused right now. This could go the distance
0:48:30,"Nice change soft to the middle and then fast rocket cross-court. I know we were talking about this before. On the road to the final, Ma Long has lost more games than Fan Zhendong."
0:48:45,in which Ma Long was pushed a little bit more in the run up to this final.
0:49:0,"Wow! Oh, it doesn't come down so close. I thought it was overturning to you, Gavin. I've seen moments like that before when I've played at Commonwealth Games and one of my teammates..."
0:49:15,Stuart Crawford he went up with the early shout of yes that's the end of the point it certainly wasn't and the ball came down onto the table not this time though pretty close to the net if that comes down you can bet the ball's going over the cameraman's heads
0:49:30,so here's an interesting one we've got a question from at table tennis daily does ma long have any weakness
0:49:45,I would say his weakness at the moment but only at this absolute elite level he's lacking that little bit of power in the the muscling muscling exchanges with fans and dong struggling a little bit when it's just racket to racket on the
0:50:0,"diagonal. It's also been a rare occasion, but recently he was beaten by Gyeongseong-Rung Korea at the Asian Championships 3-1, and I think part of that's mental game."
0:50:15,I've seen him get tight a few times and this is of course he is human being as much as Timo Boll might say he's a machine and we all joke that he's from another planet he's clearly human he's just working so hard to be at the very top of what one
0:50:30,commentator narrates a specific sports game
0:50:45,right now he's being challenged that backhand down the line first from Bong Joon-dong again it's slowed down look at the speed of the ball just like a trace of light and that's it as soon as there's speed and pace on the rally that's when you feel
0:51:0,that Fan Zhendong maybe has a 60% chance of winning the rally.
0:51:15,You can see the perspiration there. It is warm down there.
0:51:30,"It was very important for Fan Zhendong to play that ball so wide, you see Ma Long had to really reach and he tried to play it back cross court, whereas he otherwise might have tried to go down the line on this. I think maybe he was even thinking he would fool Fan Zhendong."
0:51:45,"would break over to cover the forehand, otherwise the obvious choice would have been to play the line. And that's why at this level you often see someone do the opposite of the obvious choice. Still a four point lead at the second towel break."
0:52:0,play
0:52:15,"the ball that he doesn't go for the rip, tries to play a little soft. You really have to worry about your placement because if you leave it on the table slowly and Malone gets a forehand on it, it's a lot of pressure to keep the ball right down the line here."
0:52:30,energetica Products This picture was taken on 31 July 2018
0:52:45,"So Gavin, we're two points away from Fan Zhendong sending this into the six with some momentum, some confidence and putting some real pressure on the dictator. It's getting really interesting now. Fan Zhendong there just improving on"
0:53:0,a little bit on the service delivery keeping it just a little bit lower to the net.
0:53:15,"in which the backhand player is playing in combination, keeping it deep to the backhand and challenging Ma Long to try and play it back down the line. It doesn't matter how good someone's backhand is. If you're going forehand into someone's backhand, that should be enough."
0:53:30,"Chop block doesn't land, 11-5, what a performance from Fang Zhendong again is back against the ropes and it will be for every game from here on out but game 6 is coming up right after this"
0:53:45,The monk written the poem is okay
0:54:0,"Morman Northroads, who won four gold medals at the Games and won the heyday of the seventh fastest guy in the world, sings the nation's anthem for him."
0:54:15,the champion of Russia legendary victory
0:54:30,. . . . .
0:54:45,"in which a player is asked to think about what it means, depending on who wins, for the future of the sport and who's going to be on top. Gavin, you were saying? Yeah, I mean, for Van Zendel, he was to win this. You would fancy then, the next five or six years, that he could really dominate the sport."
0:55:0,in such a strong era it is tough to be able to do that but you know a guy so young to step in take a world championship title you would feel that he would then have the confidence to build on that from ma long's perspective if he could
0:55:15,"of the year. If he was to win that, you would fancy then, you know, with that points accumulation, he could stay on and be world number one for at least another year. Yeah, we really have to wonder, when is he going to slow down?"
0:55:30,you know for a while my opinion i thought by now fang zhendong would have been world number one i've been really impressed with ma long to be able to stay on top of his game you know we've seen at 28 years old when fang zhendong or rather zhang jike
0:55:45,"with injuries and other things through the 28, was just dealing with a lot of physical difficulties. And the way Ma Long plays, that's his greatest concern, he's said it in interviews, injury. And he manages to avoid it by staying really healthy and working hard."
0:56:0,commentator narrates a specific sports game
0:56:15,you know talking about if one player wins i remember thinking as soon as fang zhendong beats malong on the world tour it's over like a pinata malong will never beat him again that hasn't been the case the china open it was a 4-0 victory for fang zhendong and malong hasn't lost
0:56:30,another one since not on the world tour see how we got right in near the back of the table if that one comes down he's in great position to counter and spin it up
0:56:45,"A nice little change of serve there from Van Zendonk. Notice how the last five games he's been serving into the short forehand. Suddenly there, serving a bit more on the diagonal, giving Marlon a different look."
0:57:0,.
0:57:15,"to Game 7, I think we're going to see a very different Ma Long attitude-wise from the start."
0:57:30,with the shoulders shrug a little bit he doesn't want to have to fight a seventh he really needs to figure out what it takes to finish it here again he was up 3-1 be a tough way to lose a championship again
0:57:45,"This title could be a contender for the greatest of all time. I mean, he's just collecting. You know, if he wins the next Olympic Games, I think many will consider Ma Long to be the greatest of all time. That's sort of the battle."
0:58:0,who can grab the big titles in the world championships one of the biggest right behind the Olympic Games I think that conversation would have been the same you know if Zhang Jike had
0:58:15,"This year in Rio or last year many people would have said he's the greatest of all time And now Ma Long has what appears to be a better chance to earn that title Sure, many people feel that he already is fun conversation"
0:58:30,in which this man tells a conversation among friends and then of course you've got the future here 20 years old assuming Fon Zhendong could stay healthy may be starting when he was about that age right there could be the next Fon Zhendong
0:58:45,the parents don't look so intense oh there they forced his hand into that shake working on the forehand stroke the mom really wants him to be a champion so Fan Zhendong up three points here with his second serve
0:59:0,commentator narrates a specific sports game
0:59:15,that inception coming in from funds and all receive a service game for resources coming times in just about the match the model well discovered the wide for him very well
0:59:30,excellent placement a bit of sidespin as it bends into the body wide on the backhand side for Fang Zhendong as flexible as that upper body is and as strong as the legs are to support Fang Zhendong to do this that shot is asking a lot
0:59:45,very similar scoreline now to when Ma Long played Timo Boll. Timo Boll was in the ascendancy in the 6th set and Ma Long came roaring back. So let's see if that happens again.
1:0:0,"Outstanding shot selection for Fang Zhendong, very bold. Ma Long starts to change the pace and instead of rocketing the backhand into the backhand side like Fang Zhendong had done before, he quickly changes it up. Seems to catch Ma Long"
1:0:15,"off guard. It's funny you brought up the Timo Boll match, you're right, I forgot, Timo Boll had a decent chance to go 7 with Ma Long, which would have been absolutely insane. Again, the atmosphere for the sold out crowd is electric here."
1:0:30,"Even the way Ma Long gives the ball back, I feel like, is just in line with the way his body language is right now on the court. Feeling a bit deflated, looking for answers."
1:0:45,series
1:1:0,sports psychologists will tell you now okay you may be going to lose this set you're 9-3 down what's important now over the next four or five points is to keep going try and find
1:1:15,in which a player is asked to find a positive mindset so that you're ready at the start of the seventh set. Very interesting stuff.
1:1:30,Legends of Legends
1:1:45,"So remember, Ma Long was up 3-1. The last time he lost from a 3-1 lead was in 2009. The power's there. Just in case you were curious who that loss was, it was against Xu Shi."
1:2:0,"the comeback team at the Qatar Open. We saw Xu Xin yesterday, the devastating comeback being down 5-10, saving five match points against the Dark Knight Lin Gaoyuan. I think the only one more"
1:2:15,painful than that for the opponent was Jun Mizutani in Kuwait from down 4-10 Shushin eight points in a row
1:2:30,"that was the most insane touch shot I've seen look at this ball, look how slow it is and how much side spin is on it I mean the chop block to set it up forces Fan Zhendong into submission for a defensive ball"
1:2:45,the Chinese players don't have the flair or the touch of the talent you know that's absolute nonsense
1:3:0,look at that it's just that most of the time you see the chinese players playing big and powerful shots they can do all the other stuff as well they can do some of the stuff that voldner can do and there's a big example of that right there yeah i couldn't agree with you more
1:3:15,"and it's not that they're not capable of playing touch, they're playing the wisest strategy to win. And that's what it takes. It's a little bit like moneyball, you look at what works and you stick to the plan. Yeah, there was no hand of concrete there as he managed to caress round the side of the net."
1:3:30,of
1:3:45,"that was relatively low. Well, that might look like Goma, popular Japanese word. It's actually Goma. Goma alone, the dragon. It's tough when the seats are equally spaced."
1:4:0,to the theme.
1:4:15,"Oh, break off the top of the net, and it's four game points. So Tong Zhendong, by the way, in case you don't speak Mandarin, Xiaopang."
1:4:30,"Little chubby, little fatty, a term of endearment is the nickname for Fan Zhendong throughout China Ma Long now Hoping to use two serves And he gets the first point, game point saved, the pressure continues"
1:4:45,"Good mess, good mess from Fan Zhendong there"
1:5:0,commentator narrates a specific sports game spectators standing over a game commentator narrates a specific sports game
1:5:15,and we are going to a seventh and deciding game it's the match we all wanted to see in the game we've all been waiting for call your friends grab your snacks and get comfy because game seven coming up right after this
1:5:30,"Personally I won't be sure about the camera angle, but let's aim it to get a better picture for this video Let me know in the comments what do you think about this game Don't forget to subscribe to my channel Thanks for watching"

1:6:15,"back to the table. You can hitting the ball on the ta up a bit more in that last shows it. Now, Gavin, we w"
1:6:30,second to last shot for the aggressive shot how he felt more comfortable trying it again.
1:6:45,before so yeah all credit to him short side of the table again a big shot to start off the game game seven again the momentum with bums and
1:7:0,Look at his legs the right. I mean the knee almost touches the ground He pulls that right foot so far back to be able to turn and play the short side
1:7:15,"Once again falling back from the table, it's down the line, it's the short side of the table for Fang Zhendong. Gavin, when is Ma Long going to pick up and start moving out to the forehand to cover and trust his backhand in the rally?"
1:7:30,It was a good spin up. He was expecting there that Fan Zhendong would play the backhand and we'd go into a backhand to backhand trade off.
1:7:45,And that's one way to handcuff the opponent. Serve it really wide to the backhand. Fang Zhendong is not likely to go for the around the net shot on the opening. Not against Ma Long.
1:8:0,at the World Championships went to seven games was a decade ago in 2007 Zagreb Wang Liqin vs. Ma Lin. Interestingly enough Wang Liqin also came back from 3-1 down.
1:8:15,he's fired up the dragon is breathing fire so even with this massive pressure on both of them the first four points nothing against the serve
1:8:30,"The American Pronunciation Guide Presents Clever idea, long push to start it off."
1:8:45,"seeing different intensity out here. Fang Zhendong with his chole and his clinched fist looked right in the eyes of Ma Long. Again, great friends off the table, but right now this fight, the gloves are off. Still playing fair. And when there's a bit of heat."
1:9:0,and a bit of pressure. Just don't miss your third ball.
1:9:15,credit again to ma long for moving anticipating well to cover the forehand it adds extra pressure for fang zhendong who has a plan he's played it successfully wide out to the forehand many times but seeing ma long waiting there makes you second guess yourself and try to play it even wider
1:9:30,
1:9:45,"Full stroke and just like you said, Gavin. Because it's the added intensity now, the pressure is there. Both players, their hand is a little bit tighter. When a player's hand is tight."
1:10:0,"you want to be attacking. And this is part of the reason we were saying earlier, the Chinese players, the top Chinese players will play boldly near the very end of a close match, and it tends to work out in their favor."
1:10:15,"Let's service, Ma Long with his hand in the air"
1:10:30,Deceptively heavy underspin.
1:10:45,"Now one thing we haven't talked about because it has it hasn't been that relevant in the match so far is the serves of Ma Long They're so deceptive, but they're very subtle. They're not flashy You know Dima has some very iconic signature serves and Ma Long"
1:11:0,the pendulum serve almost always the most traditional serve in table tennis but still with the third ball waiting and how difficult and subtle it is it's just really an intimidating an important job for the receiver to try and read it wrong
1:11:15,
1:11:30,Softball and spinning from Ma Long to take a 6-3 lead. First two points to Fang Zhendong in this game and it's been back and forth ever since but Ma Long is starting to run into a lead here.
1:11:45,"Remember, neither player has a timeout left, only one per side."
1:12:0,Great outing of the  Jungle Team Do you get an understanding of certain expenses? Visit the League of Legends Education website www.LeagueOfLegends.com
1:12:15,in that service delivery the racket of fans and dong was shaking again hopefully that's going to help him to bridge the gap these two points that he's trailing at the moment
1:12:30,I'm alone! Goal in!
1:12:45,and turns the corner sets it up well excellent use of the serves to get into the point it's like you said gavin once you turn the backhand corner and get into forehand no matter how strong your opponent's backhand is it should win the point and he has twice in a row
1:13:0,"That is what all these footwork exercises are for Get round there under this serious amount of pressure explosive big, powerful forehand To the right area Right, and actually I misspoke He's played it down the line to the short side Even more challenging"
1:13:15,for
1:13:30,like this.
1:13:45,"If I'm not mistaken, this is the first ever final in men's singles at a world championships for Fan Zhendong."
1:14:0,"Every point from here on out, Gavin. Just wasn't the racket head acceleration there from Fan Zhendong. And obviously with this Netaku ball, sometimes just going a little bit flatter and a little bit more direct."
1:14:15,"You need to accelerate the wrist to make sure you have that arc on the ball. So a second serve here to capitalize on, and it's crucial for Fan Zhendong with Ma Long's serves coming up."
1:14:30,"Oh, a break off the top of the net. He is so focused right now. I didn't even see him turn to apologize. He just immediately went down to his hand. I think thankful that he was able to take the point. And it looked like there when he was giving the ball back, he gave a little apology."
1:14:45,"Looks like Ma Long almost started to clinch his fist for that. Save your necks and edges until 3-0, 7-0. Timeouts earlier, nets and edges later."
1:15:0,"the new trend for table tennis. We saw the handshaking for Ma Long as well. The pressure on both sides, as many times as"
1:15:15,a
1:15:30,Shaking it is easier to get round and play forehands. It's very tough to have that touch and feeling on the ball for your backhand when the hand is definitely wobbling.
1:15:45,commentator narrates a specific sports game
1:16:0,Is this a changing of the guard at the top of world table tennis? Will the crown be handed down? Fan Zhendong has two serves and could decide that with these...
1:16:15,this fall in
1:16:30,this rally the grunt of ma long on that ball and he's rebalanced quickly his head just went from head height to about below the waist his body contorted screenshots are going to be going up an amazing
1:16:45,
1:17:0,And it goes long. Ma Long leaves it dangling off the forehand side. An uncomfortable ball. Will Ma Long rob this once again? What was the number one rule under pressure after a service?
1:17:15,
1:17:30,to remember how long is waiting there for the fourth ball attack for the counter and it was quite a receive to an uncomfortable place nine all in game seven ticket holders with the best investment of the year
1:17:45,Last two serve combination we will see for Ma Long. Whoa! Backhand to backhand the challenge. There was a shout from the crowd.
1:18:0,"In the middle of that, quite shocked to hear that, especially here, but to recover that ball way wide on the backhand side and keep it in play and deter the inside-out forehand. So Fan Zhendong was pointing."
1:18:15,"I'm really curious what it is. I guess just where the ball went that it went behind the scorekeeper, the assistant umpire scored me. Yeah but there was a massive shout there we could even hear that from our commentary position. I don't know if that was"
1:18:30,commentator narrates a specific sports game
1:18:45,the point of the match is against match point xiaopang on fire and ma long gave everything in the
1:19:0,at that point and still it wasn't enough to take down world number two right off the bat the back end to turning the corner and finally a shot so wide ma long a little bit farther from the table and it costs an 85
1:19:15,commentator narrates a specific sports game
1:19:30,"Deuce in the 7th, Fan Zhendong with the serve. And it goes loose! Look at the eye contact! That's the biggest celebration I've seen mid-match. Ma Long is ready. He is so ready to do it."
1:19:45,take this but it's not over yet and function don't prove that down 910 what a release of air and energy one more match point for the dragon in red
1:20:0,do you serve short or do you serve fast into the backhand run run blind and hit a forehand it's up to him
1:20:15,commentator narrates a specific sports game
1:20:30,"All on top of the world, three years unstoppable, and at 20 years old, he holds back Bong Joon Dong, who will remain number two in the world. What's it going to be? We're going to have an interview on the court from the man who..."
1:20:45,shared his love with the world after winning the olympic gold medal he can't believe it absolutely tested down to the line here both hands in the air this time and the racket that was tossed is collected along with the title
1:21:0,What a performance Gavin. He did so well on match point there. He ran round blind off the serve He gave himself lots and lots of space to rip that forehand ballsy really really positive
1:21:15,and look at him now celebrate and this is not the first time we've seen this gesture Ma Long held the flag with Zhang Jike shared the flag of China to hold up as a team after winning the Olympic Games in Rio
1:21:30,and once again immediately calls over Fan Zhendong the runner-up to share this moment with him a painful moment for Fan Zhendong but a moment of honor for China and the two best players in the world raising the
1:21:45,commentator narrates a specific sports game
1:22:0,"World Table Tennis Championships, live from Dusseldorf, Gavin, what a thriller! Unbelievable, the way that he managed to close that match out. Credit to both players, right from the start it was high, high."
1:22:15,after half of the first set when Ma Long was struggling to get into it from then on it was just exceptional stuff as he falls to the ground good thing the racket didn't come down but at this point he would take it if it had hit him in the head he probably wouldn't
1:22:30,You wouldn't have even noticed with all the elation he's feeling right now.
